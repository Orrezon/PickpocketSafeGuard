# Pickpocket Safe Guard plugin
This plugin is intended to be used to help prevent deaths while pickpocketing by preventing the "Pickpocket" action from being performed when at or below the specified HP threshold.

## Using the Pickpocket Safe Guard
The first step is to download the Pickpocket Safe Guard plugin from the Runelite Plugin Hub.

In your installed plugins, you should see "Pickpocket Safe Guard" appear in the Runelite sidebar. Click on the cog wheel to open up the settings.

Once in the settings, adjust the HP Threshold value to your desired amount. When AT or BELOW the set value, the plugin will prevent you from pickpocketing and display a message to eat food. It is recommended to set this value to whatever the NPC hits that you are pickpocketing.
